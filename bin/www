/**
 * Start a web application with Express.
 * 
 * NOTE:    The main reason for having this script
 *          instead of putting everything in app.js
 *          is to decouple configuration.
 *          Namely, configurations needed for 
 *          running a web application (this file)
 *          versus configurations for how the web
 *          application works (app.js).
 * 
 *          The lesser reason is to able to have
 *          different configurations for 
 *          different scenario.
 *          For example, a 'test' script can be
 *          used instead of this script for 
 *          running automated tests without needing
 *          to fire up the web application, or a
 *          'reset' script for resetting the web
 *          application.
